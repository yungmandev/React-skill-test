# Testing app

## Task description

Your task is to create a table from a list employees and display their logged timesheets either in a modal or a seperate page. Each employees' timesheets must be filterable by month.

Use the technologies that our web app uses (Typescript, Bootstrap/React Bootstrap etc.) and funtional components. Also, use React's Context in some way in your application.

List of employees can be found from the users.json file and timesheets from timesheets.json.

Once you are done push your project to Github and send the link the person you are in contact with.

If you have question don't hesitate to ask.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
